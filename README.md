## Features
- **Responsive Layout:** Adapts to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Product Gallery:** Image gallery to display multiple shoe products.
- **Navigation Menu:** Simple navigation bar to switch between different sections (Home, Gallery, About, Contact).
- **Custom Styling:** Clean, minimal CSS to highlight product images and text.
- **Placeholder Content:** Easily replaceable sample images and text.

To customize the content:

Edit the text in the HTML pages to update product names, descriptions, or any other details.

Modify the CSS in css/styles.css to adjust colors, fonts, or layout spacing.
